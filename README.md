# CS3307-Project
If you are having problems building the project in QT with the error:

"nightchartswidgets.h: No such file or directory"

All you need to do is give the file path for 'nightchartswidget.' Your include should look like below

<br>
nightchartswidget.h ---> from this to this ---> Charts/Nightcharts/nightchartswidget.h
